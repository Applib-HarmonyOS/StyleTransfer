# Source
This library has been inspired by [TensorflowHub\\Style Transfer](https://tfhub.dev/google/lite-model/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/int8/prediction/1).

## Integration
 1. For using StyleTransfer module in sample app, include the source code and add the below dependencies in entry/build.gradle to generate hap/support.har.

```
	implementation project(path: ':stylize')
```

 2. For using StyleTransfer module in separate application using har file, add the har file in the entry/libs folder and add the dependencies in entry/build.gradle file.

```
	implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.har'])
```
 3. For using StyleTransfer module from a remote repository in separate application, add the below dependencies in entry/build.gradle file.

```
	implementation 'dev.applibgroup:stylize:1.0.0'
```

## Usage
 1. Initialise the constructor of Stylize with the image paths, image names, getResourceManager() and getCacheDir() arguments.
 
 2. Use get_output() to get the stylized image in float matrix.
Example:

```slice
    	Stylize stylizer = new Stylize(contentImgPath, contentImgName, styleImgPath, styleImgName,
    			getResourceManager(), getCacheDir());
       outputImage = stylizer.getOutput();
```
Check the example app for more information.
